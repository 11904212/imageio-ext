ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK End-User License Agreement

IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY: This ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between You (either an individual or a single entity) and Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging, LLC, having a principle place of business at 5051 Peachtree Corners Cir., Suite 100, Norcross, Georgia, for the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK software product. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.
1. DEFINITIONS

1.1. COMMERCIAL USE means use that inures to the benefit of or is intended to inure to the benefit of a profit-seeking enterprise or an enterprise that provides services or products for consideration, regardless of whether those services or products directly relate to the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK or were performed or produced using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. Open-source projects are non-commercial until packaged in a form that the package inures to the benefit of a profit-seeking enterprise or an enterprise that provides services or products for consideration. Government use is commercial use.

1.2. DECODE means to view files compressed either using Enhanced Compression Wavelet (ECW) technology or otherwise compressed using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

1.3. ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK means computer software consisting of libraries and supporting documents that enable You to write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to decode files and/or to encode files. Among other things, the software enables compression of images according to the JPEG2000 standard, enables reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having an *.ecw extension. The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation. The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK also includes any UPDATES to the original SDK provided to You by LGGI, but not ENHANCEMENTS.

1.4. ECWP is the Enhanced Wavelet Compression Protocol, by which compressed files residing on a SERVER may be streamed to an END APPLICATION and DECODED.

1.5. ENCODE means to compress files using ECW technology or to otherwise compress using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

1.6. END APPLICATION means software products that You develop and that permit an end-user to ENCODE and/or DECODE (among other functionality You develop). END APPLICATIONS are desktop software applications intended to be distributed and used as self-contained programs for displaying and processing imagery. The source code of END APPLICATIONS is not intended to be modified by a user. END APPLICATIONS do not run on a SERVER.

1.7. ENHANCEMENTS means non-maintenance improvements, such as new features or versions.

1.8. LIBRARIES means programs that are not END APPLICATIONS and are to be used by programmers, instead of end users who use an END APPLICATION. LIBRARIES do not, by themselves, ENCODE or DECODE files, but instead are intended to be linked to by END APPLICATIONS that may ENCODE or DECODE files.

1.9. NON-COMMERCIAL USE means use that is educational or strictly personal for research.

1.10. SERVER means a computing device in a network that is used to provide services (as access to files or shared peripherals) to other computing devices in the network.

1.11. UPDATES means maintenance revisions that correct identified errors in or provide bug fixes for the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK originally provided to You.
2. LICENSE GRANT

2.1. Non-Commercial Use.

2.1.1. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create and distribute END APPLICATIONS that DECODE and/or ENCODE for NON-COMMERCIAL USES.

2.1.2. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a royalty-free, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create and distribute LIBRARIES. In distributing LIBRARIES, You are licensed only to distribute those compiled portions of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in the "redistributables" directory, which contains binaries that another application using the LIBRARY will link to.

2.2. Commercial Use.

2.2.1. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create and distribute END APPLICATIONS that DECODE for COMMERCIAL USES.

2.2.2. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, including payment of a royalty, You are hereby granted a royalty-bearing, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create and distribute END APPLICATIONS that ENCODE for COMMERCIAL USES. The royalty rate is listed on a Purchase Order that is attached to this License Agreement and that forms a part of this Agreement.

ABSENT PAYMENT OF A ROYALTY AND YOUR CONTINUING ADHERENCE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT LICENSED TO USE THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK TO ENCODE FILES FOR COMMERCIAL USES.

The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may be obtained directly from LGGI or from a person who distributes LIBRARIES containing portions of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. Regardless of the source of distribution and regardless of whether You receive the complete ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK with supporting documentation, as a compiled LIBRARY or otherwise, You must adhere to the terms of this license grant.
3. OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

3.1. Obligation to Support ECWP Read. You agree to support the reading of ECWP streams so that Your END APPLICATION is capable of receiving streamed, compressed files that adhere to the ECWP.

3.2. License Requirements for END APPLICATIONS Using ECW JPEG2000 SDK. You shall distribute the END APPLICATIONS to end-users pursuant to a conspicuous, legally enforceable end-user license that provides LGGI with substantially the same protections as set forth in Appendix A hereto. You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure the enforceability of the end-user license, including, as appropriate: (i) offering a refund of at least a portion of the purchase price of END APPLICATIONS to end-users who disagree with the terms of the end-user license including the terms set forth in Appendix A; or (ii) preventing downloading of END APPLICATIONS without acceptance of the end-user license. You also agree to take adequate steps to prevent unauthorized use of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK or its derivatives by end users who decline the end-user license offer, such as by disabling access to Your END APPLICATION or preventing access to features made possible by the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, including ENCODING or DECODING in Your END APPLICATION.

3.3. Obligations for Persons Distributing Libraries or Participating in Open Source Projects including the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. If You will distribute a LIBRARY or are using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in connection with an open-source project or other, similar work, You must distribute this license along with the object or source code of the work and give Your end users the opportunity to decline these license terms and cease downloading the work that contains or uses the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in whole or in part.

Moreover, You are not licensed to, and You agree to refrain from, any action not explicitly permitted under this Agreement.

3.6. Export Controls. You acknowledge and understand that the export or re-export of certain goods or technical data from the United States requires an export control license from the United States Government, and that failure to obtain an export control license may result in a violation of U.S. laws. The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may not be shipped, transferred, exported or re-exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations. Each party is responsible for obtaining any and all appropriate permission prior to exporting or re-exporting END APPLICATIONS or LIBRARIES.
